# U.S. States Game

## Overview
The U.S. States Game is an interactive learning tool built in Python, designed to teach players about the 50 states of the United States. Using the `turtle` graphics module for visualization and `pandas` for data handling, this game challenges players to identify states on a map, providing an engaging way to learn geography.

## Features
- Interactive graphical interface displaying a map of the U.S.
- User input for guessing state names.
- Score tracking for correct answers.
- Limit of allowed incorrect guesses.
- Generation of a list of unguessed states for further study.

## Prerequisites
Before you run the game, ensure you have the following:
- Python installed on your system (3.x recommended).
- `pandas` library installed (`pip install pandas`).
- `turtle` module (usually comes pre-installed with Python).
- The game's supporting files: `50_states.csv` and `blank_states_img.gif`.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that `50_states.csv` and `blank_states_img.gif` are in the same directory as the game script.

## Usage
To play the game, follow these steps:
1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the game's script.
3. Run the script using Python:
4. The game window will open. Start guessing states!

## How to Play
- A prompt will ask you to guess a state's name.
- Enter your guess; if it's correct, the state will appear on the map.
- The game ends after 6 incorrect guesses.
- Your score and a CSV file with states to learn will be generated at the end.
